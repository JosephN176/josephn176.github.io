  <h3> I am a highschool student with intentions of going to college and obtaining a phd in a science field. I have a previous internship experience where I learned about cybersecurity with Ben Cranshaw. I accel at criticial thinking and determination. I have perfect attendance, only technically missing one day of school. Although it was a late that wasnt my fault. When I know that im coming into school late for something I notify my teachers and ask for the missing work. In other words im a responsible person that likes to learn. </h3>
