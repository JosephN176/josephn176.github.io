      <p> I am a high school student.</p>
      <p> My favorite thing to do is to learn about technology and science.</p>
      <p> I aim to be a mechanical engineer with a PhD</p>
      <p> I taught myself skills like CAD and material science.</p>
      <p> Overall I like to learn, and value the pursuit of knowledge above all.</p>
      <p> Most people would say im overambitious, but overambitious describes people that cant do the task, I however can.</p>
      <p> If I dont have the skills to do a task, I'll get the skills needed. And do the task. </p>
      <p> I know a little bit of every field. </p>
      <p> I know just enough to know what im lacking in and fix it</p>
